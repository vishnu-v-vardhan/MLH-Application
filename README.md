# MLH-Application
## An application for Data Centalisation which in turn is used for KPI Extraction using PowerBI
This Data Centralization Web App was built to fix the
problem of scattered data in Excel sheets. Before, information was all over the place,
making it tough to create useful reports and visuals. Now, with the app, data is in one
spot, making it easy to use Business Intelligence tools like PowerBI for clear visualization of key
performance indicators of each department. This helps simplify reporting and makes
decision-making better for the organisation.
